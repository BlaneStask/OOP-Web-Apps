# Object Oriented Programming with Web-Based Applications

These are the programs for CMPSC221 at Penn State University. In this course we worked on advanced object-oriented principles and their application to web-based, net-centric computing, virtual machines, intermediate code generation (Java-specific), graphical user interfaces (GUI) design, event handling, server-side programming with database queries, security, and permissions and file management concepts for client/server systems. The GoT Trivia program utilizes JOptionPane from swing to make a GUI.

## Packages and Imports

package qanda;
import java.util.*;
import javax.swing.JOptionPane;
